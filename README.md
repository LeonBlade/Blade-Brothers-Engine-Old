Blade Brothers Engine
=====================
What is this Blade Brothers Engine?
------------------------------
The Blade Brothers Engine is my first ever actual game engine I've started to make
and it's coming along pretty smoothly.  It's a 2D game engine that uses OpenGL for rendering and SDL for window management, sound, input, etc.  Oh, and it's coded in C++!

So, why is this on git?
-----------------------
Well, I figured I'd post it as a way of keeping track of my progress I guess.
Also to show to my friends who might be interested, or potential employees that need
proof of my programming, as all these files I've written myself.

How can I get this to build?
----------------------------
This project is set up in Eclipse (the Makefile is now depreciated).
I was getting errors that were just too annoying to try to debug manually with GDB, so I'm now letting Eclipse
take over all the hard work.
I will include a Makefile for those of you that want to use it, but keep in mind that you may run into some run time errors.

Please keep in mind that I'm developing this on a Mac, so includes may change for your 
operating system or whatever.  This is obviously for people that know what they're doing,
so you'll need to fix anything like that on your own.

But... what if I have any questions?
------------------------------------
By all means, contact me!  I'll be posting a current TODO list so that you can view
what's going on, and if you want to contribute, by all means go ahead.  :)

Is that all then?
-----------------
Uh, I think so... this is really my first time using git as well, so I'm not really
sure what I should put in here or anything.  Please let me know if you have any
suggestions on what I should do.

Thanks for checking out my engine!
